Mac OS X
--------

- Linux input manager not working.

- Cmd-F    	ToggleFullscreen (some code exists in input_sdl.cpp but is disabled)
- Capslock	Pause the game
- Cmd-Tab 
		If in Full Screen:
		 	1. become windowed.
			2. Wait for the focus to leave the app
			3. Wait for the focus to return to the app
			4. become fullscreen.

- WindowManagerSDL::SaveDesktop() 
		- get currently display resolution for linux
		
- There is a problem if the user has LittleSnitch installed (A personal firewall)
	- causes NetSocketSession::WriteData to fail if not authorised.
	- If we're in fullscreen, we need to switch to windowed mode so that the user can
	  authorise the firewall, or, we need to pop up a dialog box saying 'Network Error'
	  'Cannot connect to metaserver. Please check your internet settings, including 
	   any personal firewalls.'
	- Perhaps the solution here is for the default mode to be Windowed in Mac OS X? 
	

SystemIV on Mac OS X
--------------------

debug.txt 	should go to -> ~/Application Support/<App name>/debug.txt
blackbox.txt should go to -> /Application Support/<App name>/blackbox.txt
preferences.txt should be read from ~/Application Support/<App name>/preferences.txt

General
-------

- Rename input.h to input_manager.h (consistency with window_manager)

- Input is currently linked to Eclipse.  This means I have to include
	Eclipse in projects that don't use it.

- New method for quick 3d stuff : Renderer::SetupFor3D
	
- Create a Sample starting application that uses systemIV to:
	open a window
	set up input system
	set up rendering
	render a basic square or something
