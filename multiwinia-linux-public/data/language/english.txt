research_notyetavailable               I haven't finished researching that program yet, you'll have to wait before you can use it.
research_nomorepossible                I don't think I can make any more improvements to this Program.  I think you should pick something else for me to work on.

research_squad                         I'll work on improving the Squad program.  I should be able to increase the number of squad members in a single squad.
# research_squad_v1                  Unused
research_squad_v2                      I've upgraded the Squad program that you are using.  You can now have 4 members in a squad.
research_squad_v3                      I've made some more progress on the Squad program...you'll now get 5 members to a squad.
research_squad_v4                      I've done as much as I can on the Squad program now.  You can now have 6 members.  I don't think I can get anymore out of this codebase.

research_laser                         I will try to improve the Laser program for you.  Hopefully I can get the range up a bit.
# research_laser_v1                  Unused
research_laser_v2                      I've made some improvements to the Lasers.  They should have a longer range now.
research_laser_v3                      I've improved the range of the Laser weapon again.
research_laser_v4                      These lasers are amazing now.  They're nearly 3 times longer ranged than the originals.  I'm pretty much done with this program now.

research_grenade                       I'll work on the Grenade program.  I should be able to increase the weapon range.
research_grenade_v1_kbd                You've found my research into the Grenade weapon!  This is fantastic.  While you are firing lasers with your squad, tap the Left Mouse Button to throw a Grenade.
research_grenade_v1_xin                You've found my research into the Grenade weapon!  This is fantastic.  Your squad can now throw Grenades.

research_grenade_v2                    I've increased the throw range of the Grenade program.
research_grenade_v3                    I've made another increase to the Grenade throw range.
research_grenade_v4                    That's it, I'm done with the grenades now.  The throw range has been pushed up as far as it will go.

research_rocket                        I'll get to work on the Rockets.  Hopefully I can increase their maximum range a bit.
research_rocket_v1_kbd                 Excellent, you've recovered the Rocket program.  You can select this Weapon with the Rocket gesture.  While you are firing lasers with your squad, tap the Left Mouse Button to launch a Rocket.

research_rocket_v4                     The rocket range is at its maximum now.

research_airstrike                     I'll try to improve the AirStrike for you.
research_airstrike_v1                  Oh my goodness, this is excellent.  You've found my AirStrike program!  Select Airstrike as your Squad weapon by drawing the gesture, then throw the marker grenade to show the program where to bomb.
research_airstrike_v1_icons_kbd        Oh my goodness, this is excellent.  You've found my AirStrike program!  Click on the Airstrike icon in the Task Manager to select this Weapon, then throw the marker grenade to show the program where to bomb.

research_airstrike_v2                  I've improved the AirStrike program.  Each marker grenade will now summon two Invaders to drop their bombs.
research_airstrike_v3                  I've added another Invader to each AirStrike unit.
research_airstrike_v4                  There will now be four Invaders for every AirStrike marker.  I've done all I can here.

research_taskmanager                   I'll work on upgrading the Task Manager for you. It should be possible to run more programs simultaneously, with some tweaking.
# research_taskmanager_v1            Unused
# research_taskmanager_v2            Unused
research_taskmanager_v3                I've made some changes to the Task Manager.  You can now run up to four programs simultaneously.
research_taskmanager_v4                I've upgraded the Task Manager.  Now you can run five programs at once.  This is already pushing the system to its limits, so I don't think I can improve it anymore.

research_darwinian                     I'll try to improve the basic Darwinian code template.  Hopefully I should be able to give them some decent weapons to defend themselves.
# research_darwinian_v1              Unused
# research_darwinian_v2              Unused
research_darwinian_v3                  I've upgraded the Darwinians so they can use Lasers!  This should help them defend against the Viral attack.
research_darwinian_v4                  I've given the Darwinians Grenades.  It's a bit scary, but they should have a chance against stronger foes now.  I've done all I can here.

research_engineer                      I'll work on improving the Engineers.  I think I can increase the number of spirits they can carry.
# research_engineer_v1               Unused
research_engineer_v2                   I've increased the number of spirits your Engineers can carry to 15.
research_engineer_v3                   I've increased the number of spirits your Engineers can carry to 25.
research_engineer_v4                   I've increased the spirit capacity of your Engineers to 30.  I've finished work on the Engineers now.

research_armour                        I'll do some more work on the Armour program.  I think I can improve the capacity of the Armour, and maybe the range of the Battle Cannon.
# research_armour_v1                 Unused
research_armour_v2                     I've upgraded the Armour program.  You can now fit 20 Darwinians inside.  I've also increased the range of the Battle Cannon.
research_armour_v3                     The Armour program has been upgraded again.  You can now fit 30 Darwinians inside.  And I've increased the range of the Battle Cannon to more than twice its original spec.
research_armour_v4                     I've increased the capacity of the Armour program to 40 Darwinians.  And the Battle Cannon is now at its maximum range.  I've done all I can here.

research_officer                       I will get to work improving the Officer program.  I should be able to give him some useful Orders which we can use to influence the Darwinians.
# research_officer_v1                Unused
# research_officer_v2                Unused
research_officer_v3_kbd                I've upgraded the Officer program so they can now issue a FOLLOW order as well as the existing GOTO order.  Right click near an officer to toggle his orders.
research_officer_v3_xin                I've upgraded the Officer program so they can now issue a FOLLOW order as well as the existing GOTO order.

research_officer_v4_kbd                I've given the Officers a new order called ABSORB.  This will absorb all nearby friendly Darwinians into a protective shield, which will keep the Officer safe in dangerous areas.  Right click near an officer to toggle his orders.
research_officer_v4_xin                I've given the Officers a new order called ABSORB.  This will absorb all nearby friendly Darwinians into a protective shield, which will keep the Officer safe in dangerous areas.

research_explanation_1                 I'm going to keep working on the programs you are using for a while...the Squads, Engineers etc.
research_explanation_2                 Most of them are still in very early stages of beta testing and I think I can improve all of them quite a bit with some work.

tutorial_intro_3                       Welcome to Darwinia...what's left of it.
tutorial_intro_4                       Darwinia is the world's first ever Digital Theme Park - everything you see here is simulated on a computer.
tutorial_intro_5                       Unfortunately we're currently under attack by a major Viral Infection which has destroyed pretty much everything.
tutorial_intro_6                       This location is called the Pixel Mines.  Raw Polygons are mined from the Quarries in the distance and are refined into Primitives in this building.
tutorial_intro_7                       Essentially this entire location produces the raw materials we need to build things in Darwinia.
tutorial_intro_8                       Unfortunately it's all offline right now due to the viral infection.  I want you to help me fix that.
tutorial_intro_9                       We're going to need to wipe out the Viral infection, and rebuild the population of the native Darwinians.
tutorial_intro_10                      But let's start with the basics.

tutorial_1_kbd                         Firstly let's get to grips with the camera.Use the [KEYCAMERAFORWARDS],[KEYCAMERALEFT],[KEYCAMERABACKWARDS],[KEYCAMERARIGHT] keys to move the camera around.
tutorial_1_xin                         Firstly let's get to grips with the camera.
tutorial_2_kbd                         To change the camera's height, scroll your middle mouse button up and down.  Or you can press [KEYCAMERAUP] and [KEYCAMERADOWN].
tutorial_3                             Good stuff.  Now the first thing I want you to do is to destroy these evil Red Virii.
tutorial_3b                            We will then harvest the Souls from their dead bodies and convert them into some perky new Darwinians.
tutorial_4                             In order to destroy those Virii, we will need to create an armed offensive unit called a SQUAD.
tutorial_4b_kbd                        To create things in Darwinia you draw gestures in the Task Manager.  Hold the [KEYGESTURESTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] key to bring up the Task Manager.
tutorial_4b_xin                        To create things in Darwinia you draw gestures in the Task Manager.
tutorial_5                             With the Task Manager open, draw this gesture to create a SQUAD.  You don't need to be very accurate, just draw it fast.
tutorial_5_kbd                         While holding [KEYGESTURESTASKMANAGERDISPLAY], draw this gesture to create a SQUAD.  You don't need to be very accurate, just draw it fast.
tutorial_5_error                       Whoops, that's the wrong gesture.  Try again.
tutorial_7_kbd                         Excellent.  Now in order to place the SQUAD into the world, click inside the highlighted starting area.
tutorial_7_xin                         Excellent.  Now in order to place the SQUAD into the world, select the highlighted starting area.
tutorial_8_kbd                         Squads need to be directly controlled.  Click the Left Mouse Button to move them around the landscape.
tutorial_9_kbd                         Hold the Right Mouse Button to fire their lasers.
tutorial_10_kbd                        They can also throw grenades.  Hold the Right Mouse Button to fire lasers, then tap the Left Mouse Button to throw a grenade.
tutorial_11                            Looks like you've got the hang of it.  Take your squad over to those evil Red Virii and kill them!
tutorial_12                            Fantastic, you've destroyed half of them already.
tutorial_13                            You're very nearly done.  Just a few more Virii remain.

tutorial_20                            This building is an Incubator.  Its purpose is to convert the Souls of dead creatures into fresh new Darwinians.
tutorial_20b                           Unfortunately it's currently offline, due to the red viral Infection.  We need to use it to start creating Darwinians.
tutorial_20c                           To bring the building online we will need to use an ENGINEER.
tutorial_21_kbd                        To summon an ENGINEER, hold [KEYGESTURESTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] to access the Task Manager and draw this gesture.
tutorial_21_xin                        To summon an ENGINEER, open the Task Manager and draw this gesture.
tutorial_22                            Engineers can be placed in starting points, or near Squads.  Place your Engineer and move him near the Incubator.
tutorial_23                            The first thing the Engineer will do is to reprogram the Incubator and remove the Viral infection, using the nearby Control Tower.
tutorial_24                            The Engineer will now collect up the Souls left behind by the dead Virii and carry them to the Incubator.
tutorial_24b                           All creatures in Darwinia have a Soul.  The Souls used to belong to the Darwinians before the Virus corrupted them.
tutorial_24c                           Using Engineers and Incubators, we can gradually harvest the evil Virus Souls and convert them back into native Darwinians.
tutorial_25                            The first Darwinians have been reborn!  This is fantastic news.
tutorial_26                            These guys used to own the planet, before the Virus invaded.  And it's these guys that we're going to help to recapture the world.

tutorial_28_kbd                        Hold [KEYGESTURESTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and draw this gesture to create another SQUAD.
tutorial_28_xin                        Open the Task Manager and draw this gesture to create another SQUAD.
tutorial_29                            You can now start your SQUAD closer to the action, by placing them near the Control Tower you captured.

tutorial_30                            Ok, next task.
tutorial_31                            There are more evil creatures in this direction, including a rather nasty Centipede.
tutorial_31b                           I want you to wipe them out with Squads, then harvest their spirits into Darwinians.
tutorial_32                            Now take your Squad and attack the Viral infection that I just showed you.
tutorial_33                            Excellent work.  I'm very impressed.
tutorial_33b                           We now want to use an Engineer to reprogram this Incubator, and to collect up the nearby Souls.
tutorial_34_kbd                        Now move the Engineer near to the new Incubator so he can begin Reprogramming it.  Just Left Click to move an Engineer.
tutorial_34_xin                        Now move the Engineer near to the new Incubator so he can begin Reprogramming it.
tutorial_35                            That Engineer will now pick up the nearby Souls and place them in the Incubator, creating more Darwinians.
tutorial_35b                           Let me show you how to move the existing Darwinians around.
tutorial_35c                           Darwinians can't be directly controlled, but we can issue orders to them using an Officer.
tutorial_351                           To create an Officer, draw this gesture.
tutorial_36_kbd                        Click on an existing Darwinian to promote him to an Officer.
tutorial_36_xin                        Select an existing Darwinian to promote him to an Officer.
tutorial_37                            The most useful function if Officers is that they can order Darwinians around.
tutorial_37_kbd                        Officers can be moved around by Left Clicking.  But they're most useful function is that they can order Darwinians around.
tutorial_37b_kbd                       You can right click somewhere on the ground to order all the nearby Darwinians to walk there.
tutorial_38                            The ultimate objective here is to get this Refinery online so we can start producing some Primitives.
tutorial_38b                           The Refinery needs Darwinians at its base in order to operate.
tutorial_38c                           However the Darwinians can't currently defend themselves, so you'll need to clear the area out first using Squads.
tutorial_38d                           Once you've done that, use Officers to order the Darwinians up to the Refinery and they will begin operating it.
tutorial_38e                           Don't forget to use Engineers to collect up the Souls of dead Virii and Darwinians.
tutorial_39_kbd                        If you get stuck at any time, you can press [KEYSEPULVEDAHELP] and I'll try to help you. Good luck!

tutorial_40                            You have a Squad running already, but you aren't currently controlling it because it isn't the selected unit.
tutorial_40b_kbd                       To select your Squad, hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and press the TAB key until the Squad is selected.  Or you can just click on the Squad directly.

tutorial_41_kbd                        To summon another ENGINEER, hold [KEYGESTURESTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] to access the Task Manager and draw this gesture.
tutorial_41_xin                        To summon another ENGINEER, open the Task Manager and draw this gesture.
tutorial_42                            Now place the Engineer near a Squad or a Control Tower.

tutorial_43                            You already have an Engineer running, but it isn't currently selected.
tutorial_43b_kbd                       To select your Engineer, hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and TAB along until it is selected.  Or you can just click directly on the Engineer.

tutorial_squaddeath                    Looks like your SQUAD has been destroyed.  Not to worry, we can just create another.
tutorial_engineerdeath                 Unfortunately your ENGINEER has been destroyed.  We'll need to create another.

tutorial_skipped_kbd                   Ok I'll just let you get on with it.  Remember you can press [KEYSEPULVEDAHELP] at any time for help.  Good luck!
tutorial_skipped_xin                   Ok I'll just let you get on with it. Good luck!

pixelmines_objective1                  Refine 20 Primitives
pixelmines_objective2                  Enable Yard Trunk Port

pixelmines_intro_1                     This entire location is one giant mining facility, unfortunately now overrun by this damn Virus.
pixelmines_refinery_1                  This building at the centre of the facility is the Refinery.  It converts mined Polygons into Primitives which can be used later to build things.
pixelmines_refinery_1b                 It also drives the motor system that moves the carts around the track.
pixelmines_refinery_2                  This Refinery needs Darwinians at its control pads or else it's useless.  You'll need to safely escort some Darwinians up here to get the facility moving.
pixelmines_mines_1                     There are four underground mines built into the side of the landscape.  Each one pulls raw Polygons from the mountainside.
pixelmines_mines_1b                    Generations of Darwinian miners have worked these quarries and it's starting to show its toll on the hillside.
pixelmines_mines_2                     The Darwinians will extract the Polygons from deep inside the quarry and dump them into the mining carts as they move past, on their way to the Refinery.
pixelmines_mines_3                     We'll need to mine at least 20 Primitives to be able to build anything substantial.

pixelmines_yardport_1                  Once the Primitives have been refined, they need to be transported to the Construction Yard where they can be used to build things.
pixelmines_yardport_2                  Bring this Trunk Port online so the refined Primitives can be transported away.

pixelmines_progress_1                  Wonderful work, the Refinery is online and the motor system is running.  But the mine carts are still empty.  We need to bring the Mines themselves online to fill the carts.
pixelmines_progress_2                  There are four underground mines built into the side of the landscape.  Each one pulls raw Polygons from the mountainside.

launchpad_primary_1                    There are three Fuel Pumps on this map.
launchpad_primary_2                    Their function is to extract raw minerals from the sea bed, and process it into liquid fuel the Rocket can use in its engines.
launchpad_primary_4                    The Fuel Pumps are powered by Solar Panels nearby.
launchpad_primary_5                    These Solar panels require Darwinians at their base in order to operate.
launchpad_primary_6                    Clear out the Viral infection around the Solar panels, then escort some Darwinians to them using Officers.
launchpad_primary_7                    Once operational the Solar Panels will power the Fuel Pump, which will in-turn push liquid fuel into the Rocket.

launchpad_primary_rocket_1             Our primary aim is to help the Darwinians launch their Rocket.
launchpad_primary_rocket_2             In order to do that we will first need to refuel it.
launchpad_primary_rocket_3             The fuel is generated by the 3 highlighted Fuel Pumps, which push the fuel direct into the Rocket's fuel tanks.
launchpad_primary_rocket_4             Bring those Fuel Pumps online by manning the solar panels around the map with Darwinians.
launchpad_primary_rocket_5             Once the Rocket is fully refuelled we will be able to attempt another launch.

launchpad_intro_1                      Greetings visitor, and welcome to Darwinia!
launchpad_intro_2                      My name is Dr Sepulveda and I'm the creator of this digital world.
launchpad_intro_3                      You've come at a great time.  The native Darwinians have been busy.
launchpad_intro_4                      Since the end of the Great War they've taken it upon themselves to build a rocket.
launchpad_intro_5                      The Darwinians are a totally digital lifeform, running inside a very large supercomputer.
launchpad_intro_6                      Each generation is more ambitious than the last.  They all want to be the first into their new rocket.
launchpad_intro_7                      They're incredibly curious little fellows!
launchpad_intro_8                      I'm not sure what the Darwinians ultimately wish to achieve here.
launchpad_intro_9                      But this is clearly their most ambitious project yet.
launchpad_intro_9b                     They've been growing and improving for thousands of generations and have their very own culture and beliefs.
launchpad_intro_9c                     This rocket is the culmination of all their dreams and ambitions, and it's taken them an incredibly long time to get this far.
launchpad_intro_10                     My God, we're under attack!
launchpad_intro_11                     The Red Darwinians are attacking!
launchpad_intro_12                     My God, they're trying to destroy the Rocket!
launchpad_intro_13                     This is insane, they'll cause an explosion that will wipe out all the Darwinians inside!
launchpad_intro_14                     My God.
launchpad_intro_15                     I can't believe this is happening.

launchpad_logo_1					   DARWINIA+

launchpad_middemo_1                    Darwinia wasn't always like this.
launchpad_middemo_2                    I can still remember a time before the Virus came, before the great war that almost destroyed this world.
launchpad_middemo_3                    The Darwinians fought so hard, and came so far, and I really did think we'd cleared the system of the infection.
launchpad_middemo_4                    But it seems now that every time I turn my back, there's another outbreak somewhere and more Darwinians are killed.
launchpad_middemo_5                    The control the Darwinians now have over their world is amazing.
launchpad_middemo_6                    The Launchpad is one of many locations in Darwinia, but it's the first the Darwinians have built entirely on their own.
launchpad_middemo_8                    Look at what they've achieved!
launchpad_middemo_9                    The renderer you're looking at didn't know what to do outside the confines of the world...it used to be just a blank space.
launchpad_middemo_10                   But the Darwinians knew there was more.  They manipulated the rendering subsystem until they could see beyond their world.
launchpad_middemo_11                   Those star systems are other mainframes and servers on the Internet, all connected in a giant world wide web.
launchpad_middemo_12                   I realise now that their intention is to explore the millions of computer systems they can now see around them.
launchpad_middemo_13                   The Great Rocket project will be their finest achievement, and it will open their horizons to every computer system in the world.
launchpad_middemo_14                   And if it wasn't for this Virus, they'd already be out there.

# launchpad_middemo_5                As bleak as the Great War was for the Darwinians, it made them grow and learn at an astonishing rate.
# launchpad_middemo_6                Forced to fight for their lives or face extinction, the Darwinians came further in those few intensely violent days than the entire decade of evolution beforehand.

launchpad_tutorial_1                   Right, we're going to have to help the Darwinians.
launchpad_tutorial_2_kbd               Firstly let's get to grips with the camera.  Use the [KEYCAMERAFORWARDS], [KEYCAMERALEFT], [KEYCAMERABACKWARDS] and [KEYCAMERARIGHT] keys to move the camera around.
launchpad_tutorial_2_xin               Firstly let's get to grips with the camera.  Use the Left Thumbstick to move the camera, and the Right Thumbstick to to rotate the camera.
launchpad_tutorial_3                   To change the camera's height, use the Left Trigger and Right Trigger buttons.
launchpad_tutorial_3_kbd               To change the camera's height, scroll your middle mouse button up and down.  Or you can press [KEYCAMERAUP] and [KEYCAMERADOWN].
launchpad_tutorial_4_kbd               In order to combat the Red menace, we're going to have to create some offensive units.  Hold the [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] key to bring up the Task Manager.
launchpad_tutorial_4_xin               In order to combat the Red menace, we're going to have to create some offensive units. Press X to bring up the Task Manager.
launchpad_tutorial_5_kbd               The SQUAD is your primary weapon against the evil Red army.  Create a SQUAD by clicking on the squad icon in the middle of the screen while the Task Manager is open.
launchpad_tutorial_5_xin               The SQUAD is your primary weapon against the evil Red army.  Create a SQUAD by selecting the squad icon in the middle of the screen and pressing A.
launchpad_tutorial_5_error             That's the wrong Icon.  Try again.
launchpad_tutorial_6_kbd               In order to place the new SQUAD into the world, click inside the highlighted starting area.
launchpad_tutorial_6_xin               In order to place the new SQUAD into the world, move the cursor into the highlighted area and press A.
launchpad_tutorial_7_kbd               Squads need to be directly controlled.  Click the Left Mouse Button to move them around the landscape.
# NOTE: tutorial_7_xin contains hardcoded controls, rather than [ASSIGNMENT]'s. 
launchpad_tutorial_7_xin               Squads need to be directly controlled.  Left Thumbstick moves the squad, and the Left and Right Triggers will rotate the camera while the squad is selected.
launchpad_tutorial_8                   To fire the Squad's lasers, press the Right Thumbstick in the direction you want to fire.
launchpad_tutorial_8_kbd               Hold the Right Mouse Button to fire their lasers.
launchpad_tutorial_9                   Now take your Squad and wipe out those evil Virii nearby. Don't let them get too close!
launchpad_tutorial_9_error             Looks like your Squad has been destroyed.  Not to worry, we can just create another.
launchpad_tutorial_10                  That blue glowing item up ahead is a piece of my Research.  It contains a weapon we can use against the Red Virii.
launchpad_tutorial_11_kbd              In order to capture this Research we need to create an Engineer. Hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY], then click on the Engineer button.
launchpad_tutorial_11_xin              In order to capture this Research we need to create an Engineer. Open the Task Manager (X Button), use the Left Thumbstick to select the Engineer Icon, then press A.
launchpad_tutorial_12                  Place your new Engineer near your Squad and move him near the Research item.
launchpad_tutorial_12b                 Engineers are just dumb debugging tools, but they serve a number of purposes.
launchpad_tutorial_12c                 Here you can see the Engineer collecting up that piece of research.
launchpad_tutorial_12d                 Once he's done he will upload it to my system, and we can make some use of it.
launchpad_tutorial_12e                 You might find other Research floating around like this.  It would be very helpful if you could collect it for me.
launchpad_tutorial_13                  Fantastic, you've managed to recapture the Grenade weapon.
launchpad_tutorial_13b_kbd             Click on the existing Squad to switch control back to them.  Alternatively you can click on them in the Task Manager, or you can press 1.
launchpad_tutorial_13b_xin             Select the existing Squad by either moving the cursor over them and pressing the A button, or using the Left Bumper and Right Bumper to cycle through your units until the Squad is selected.  Alternatively you can select them in the Task Manager using the Left Thumbstick and the A button.
launchpad_tutorial_14                  Try throwing a Grenade.
launchpad_tutorial_14_xin              While you are firing the Squad's lasers, press the Right Trigger button to throw a grenade. 
launchpad_tutorial_14_kbd              While you are holding the Right Mouse Button to fire lasers, tap the Left Mouse Button to throw a Grenade.
launchpad_tutorial_15                  Now I'd recommend you take your squad, and wipe out those Virii over the hill using your new weapons.
launchpad_tutorial_16                  We need to reach the Radar dish nearby, so make sure you get them all.
launchpad_tutorial_17                  This building is a Radar Dish.  Radar dishes can be used to travel between disconnected islands.
launchpad_tutorial_18                  We're now going to use it to open up a link to the neighbouring island, then we're going to send the Squad through that link.
launchpad_tutorial_19                  Unfortunately this Radar Dish has been infected with the same Red virus you've been fighting.
launchpad_tutorial_20                  In order to use it we must first make our Engineer reprogram it to clear out the viral infection.
launchpad_tutorial_21_kbd              Reselect your Engineer and move him near the Radar Dish to begin reprogramming.  Click on his icon in the Task Manager to reselect him, or just click on him directly.
launchpad_tutorial_21_xin              Reselect your Engineer and move him near the Radar Dish to begin reprogramming.  Move the cursor over it and press A, or use the Left and Right Bumpers to cycle to through your current units until it is selected.
launchpad_tutorial_22                  The Engineer can access the Radar Dish via the nearby Control Tower.  He's reprogramming it now so we can use it.
launchpad_tutorial_23_kbd              Ok the Radar Dish is now under our control.  Deselect your Engineer by pressing [KEYUNITDESELECT], then click on the Radar Dish.
launchpad_tutorial_23_xin              Ok the Radar Dish is now under our control.  Deselect your Engineer by pressing the B button, then select the Radar Dish by highlighting it with the cursor and pressing A.
launchpad_tutorial_24_kbd              Now align the Dish by clicking on the receiver on the distant island.  I've highlighted the receiver for you.  You can zoom with the middle mouse button or the [KEYCAMERAZOOM] key.
launchpad_tutorial_24_xin              Now align the Dish with the receiver on the distant island by moving your cursor over it and pressing A. You can zoom the camera by clicking the Left Thumbstick to make this easier.  I've highlighted the receiver for you.
launchpad_tutorial_25_kbd              You should now see the dishes are aligned, and we can send our Squad through.  Deselect the dish by pressing [KEYUNITDESELECT], then reselect your SQUAD.
launchpad_tutorial_25_xin              You should now see the dishes are aligned, and we can send our Squad through.  Deselect the dish by pressing the B Button, then reselect your SQUAD.
launchpad_tutorial_26_kbd              You can now send your SQUAD through the dish by clicking on it while they are selected.
launchpad_tutorial_26_xin              You can now send your SQUAD through the dish simply by moving them towards it.

launchpad_tutorial_defend_1            Be careful, there are more Virii nearby.
launchpad_tutorial_defend_2            Defend yourself!
launchpad_tutorial_clearincubator            You should kill all the Virii around that building before moving on. Please go back and do that first.

launchpad_tutorial_40                  This building is an Incubator.  It's a very important building in Darwinia.
launchpad_tutorial_41                  We can use it to convert the souls of those creatures you've just killed into Darwinians.
launchpad_tutorial_42                  But just like the Radar Dish, the first thing we need to do is reprogram it to remove the viral infection.
launchpad_tutorial_43_kbd              Create an Engineer near the Incubator to reprogram it.  Just hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and click on the Engineer button.  Or you can press [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERNEWENGINEER].
launchpad_tutorial_43_xin              Create an Engineer near the Incubator to reprogram it.  Just open the Task Manager, select the Engineer button and press A. You can use more than one Engineer to make this faster.
launchpad_tutorial_44                  Now that the Incubator is online, you will see the Engineer harvesting souls.
launchpad_tutorial_45                  All creatures in this world have a soul - regardless if they are a friendly Darwinian or an evil Virus.
launchpad_tutorial_46                  Engineers can pick up the souls of dead creatures and deposit them into Incubator buildings for rebirth.
launchpad_tutorial_47                  The Incubators will convert the souls one at a time into new Darwinians.
launchpad_tutorial_48                  This is how we fight the virus - we destroy their evil red forms, harvest their souls, and convert them into friendly Darwinians.
launchpad_tutorial_49                  Good work - the first Darwinians have been born.
launchpad_tutorial_50                  As I was saying earlier, they're an incredibly curious lot, and I made a point of designing them with their own sense of free will.
launchpad_tutorial_51                  We can't directly control them like we do with the Squaddies and Engineers.
launchpad_tutorial_52                  But they will listen to their own - we can influence them using Officers.
launchpad_tutorial_53                  The Officer research is up ahead.  Wipe out the Virus around it, and capture the research using an Engineer.
launchpad_tutorial_54                  Ok to fill you in on the plan, what I'm trying to do is to refuel the Rocket so the Darwinians can have another go at launching it.
launchpad_tutorial_54b                 Eventually we're going to have to face those evil Red Darwinians around the rocket, but before we can do that we need to refuel it.
launchpad_tutorial_55                  Most of the rocket fuel was burnt away in the attack and we need to resupply it.
launchpad_tutorial_56                  The rocket fuel is generated by three Fuel Pumps dotted around the main island.  Here's one of them.
launchpad_tutorial_57                  Their job is to extract raw fuel from the sea bed and refine it into Rocket fuel, which is then pumped into the rocket's fuel tanks.
launchpad_tutorial_58                  Unfortunately all three Fuel Pumps are offline, and need power in order to operate.
launchpad_tutorial_59                  That power is generated by these Solar Panels.
launchpad_tutorial_60                  In order to make these Solar Panels work we need to escort some Darwinians to each of them.
launchpad_tutorial_61                  And the piece of Research you've just picked up will do just that - it will allow us to guide the Darwinians around using Officers.
launchpad_tutorial_62_kbd              Hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and click on the button to create an Officer.  Or you can press [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERNEWOFFICER].
launchpad_tutorial_62_xin              Open the Task Manager, select the button and press A to create an Officer. If your task list is already full, select one of your current tasks and press the Y button to destroy it.
launchpad_tutorial_63_kbd              Now we need to select a Darwinian to promote to be our Officer.  Click on any of these Darwinians to promote them.
launchpad_tutorial_63_xin              Now we need to select a Darwinian to promote to be our Officer.  Move your cursor over any of these Darwinians and press A to promote them.
launchpad_tutorial_64_kbd              We can now influence the other Darwinians around us. Right click on the Officer to put him into FOLLOW mode.
launchpad_tutorial_64_xin              We can now influence the other Darwinians around us. With the Officer selected, highlight him with the cursor and use the D-Pad to put him into FOLLOW mode.
launchpad_tutorial_65                  Those Darwinians would now follow the Officer wherever he went.  In this case, we've gathered together all the Darwinians nearby.
launchpad_tutorial_66_kbd              Right click near the Solar Panels to put the Officer into GOTO mode.
launchpad_tutorial_66_xin              Move over to the Solar Panels, and use the D-Pad to put the Officer into GOTO mode.
launchpad_tutorial_67                  The Officer is ordering all the nearby Darwinians to march to that spot.
launchpad_tutorial_68                  You can have as many Officers as you need.  Now Use Officers to occupy the control panels around the base of each of the three Solar Panels.
launchpad_tutorial_69                  Excellent work.  The first batch of Solar Panels are up and running.
launchpad_tutorial_70                  So long as they have Darwinians operating them they will continue to generate power for as long as we need it.
launchpad_tutorial_71                  The first Fuel Pump is now receiving that power and has begun extracting raw fuel from the ocean bed.
launchpad_tutorial_72                  There's a whole digital ecosystem under the ocean that has been running for over a decade, so there's no shortage of minerals that we can use as fuel.
launchpad_tutorial_73                  Of course, I didn't realise this - the Darwinians came up with the idea of mining the ocean beds for fuel.
launchpad_tutorial_74                  You can see the first of the Rocket Fuel being pumped into the rocket's fuel tanks now.
launchpad_tutorial_75                  Anyway.
launchpad_tutorial_76                  There are still two more Fuel Pumps that need powering up, so we'd better get on with it.
launchpad_tutorial_77                  You should probably head this way next. Reprogram this Radar Dish using an Engineer and connect to the far island, then send your Squad through. 

launchpad_reprogram_1_kbd              To align this Radar Dish, first wait until it has been reprogrammed, then deselect your current task by pressing [KEYUNITDESELECT].
launchpad_reprogram_1_xin              To align this Radar Dish, first wait until it has been reprogrammed, then deselect your current task.
launchpad_reprogram_2_kbd              You can then click on the Radar Dish, and align it by clicking on the receiving Radar Dish.
launchpad_reprogram_2_xin              You can then select the Radar Dish by pressing A while it is highlighted, and align it by pressing A on the receiving Radar Dish. Remember you can zoom by clicking the Left Thumbstick to make this easier.
launchpad_reprogram_3_kbd              When you are done, deselect the dish by pressing [KEYUNITDESELECT].
launchpad_reprogram_3_xin              When you are done, deselect the dish with the B button.

launchpad_dgupgrade_1                  You've found some of my Research into Darwinian weaponry!
launchpad_dgupgrade_2                  This research item will equip our green Darwinians with the same grenades your Squaddies are using.
launchpad_dgupgrade_3                  Our Darwinians will stand a much better chance against those evil Red Virii now that they have Grenades.

launchpad_finalintro_1                 This island is heavily infected with the Virus.
launchpad_finalintro_2                 Remember to capture the nearby Incubator with an Engineer, and harvest the souls of the dead as you kill them.
launchpad_finalintro_3                 Don't be afraid to use the newly born Darwinians as fighters, by ordering them to attack the enemy with your Officers.

launchpad_finalisland_1                The three Fuel Pumps are now operating perfectly, and the Rocket is being refuelled.  Well done.
launchpad_finalisland_2                We now face the final hurdle.  We must attack and destroy the evil red Darwinians that occupy the launch pad.
launchpad_finalisland_3                Those buildings they are clustered around are called Spawn Points.  You'll need to take control of them from the Red Army.
launchpad_finalisland_4                You can think of these buildings as Incubators running on automatic - they will spawn new Darwinians endlessly, until a certain population is reached.
launchpad_finalisland_5                Currently they are controlled by the Red Darwinians, so the newly spawned Darwinians will also be Red.
launchpad_finalisland_6                Once you capture the first of these Spawn Points you will start receiving new Green Darwinians immediately.
launchpad_finalisland_7                In order to capture the first Spawn Point you will need to bring friendly Green Darwinians through this Radar Dish link.
launchpad_finalisland_8                The Red Darwinians will attack you as soon as you take the first Spawn Point from them, so be careful.
launchpad_finalisland_9                And good luck!

launchpad_reprogram2_1                 Align this Radar dish to the centre island.
launchpad_reprogram2_2                 You can then guide Darwinians through the link using an Officer. Simply give the Officer a GOTO order while the Radar Dish is highlighted.

launchpad_success_1                    We've done it!
launchpad_success_2                    I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

garden_intro_1                         Who the hell are you?  How did you get in here?
garden_intro_2                         I thought I'd terminated all external connections.
garden_intro_3                         OK fine, if you're going to stay you can at least make yourself useful.
garden_intro_4                         Take some time to get your bearings, then help me wipe out this Red Virus.
garden_intro_5_kbd                     If you get stuck, press [KEYSEPULVEDAHELP] and I'll give you some tips.

garden_foundscroll_1                   Excellent work!  The Engineers will now busy themselves downloading that item of Research into my computer.
garden_foundscroll_2                   Unfortunately almost all of my research was lost a few hours ago when this virus outbreak occurred, so you may run into more research like this one later on.
garden_foundscroll_3                   It will be extremely helpful to me if you could use Engineers to download each research item when you find them.  I'm extremely busy right now trying to stop this damn Virus, and I don't have time to sort it out myself.

garden_souls_1                         You may have noticed those Virii leaving little red things behind when you killed them.  Those are digital DNA...digital souls, if you'll excuse the term.
garden_souls_2                         Every living creature in Darwinia has its own digital soul.  Originally they were intended for the Darwinians, but the Virus has swallowed most of them up by now.
garden_opentrunkport_1                 Before we can sort this out, we need to get out of this location.  What I need you to do here is to open up this Trunk Port for me.
garden_opentrunkport_2                 It's got a standard Control Tower nearby, so you can send in one of your Engineers to reprogram it and then we'll be able to use it.

# ================================================

gardenfinished_1                       I'm sorry if I was rude to you on that island, I've had my hands full for the past few hours.
gardenfinished_2                       My name is Dr Sepulveda, and I'm the Creator of the Darwin Digital Life project.  I would normally welcome you to Darwinia and show you around, but I'm afraid things have gone a bit wrong today and we'll have to give the guided tour a miss.
gardenfinished_3                       I need you to help me open up some more of the infected locations.  The Containment location is sort of a hub world.  Please go to that location and I'll explain more when you've connected.


# ================================================
# Containment field
# ================================================

containment_primary_1                  We need to start rebuilding the Darwinian population.  The Incubators are the key.
containment_primary_2                  Clear the viral infection outside the shielded area, then use Engineers to collect the souls of the dead Virii and carry them to the Incubators.
containment_primary_3                  There are three Incubators dotted around this location, and they will rebirth the collected enemy souls into Darwinians.
containment_primary_4                  Promote some of the Darwinians to Officers, and use them to escort the remaining Darwinians safely back to the inside of the shielded area.
containment_primary_5                  I want you to rescue at least 150 Darwinians in this manner, just to be on the safe side.  The Darwinians will be safe inside the shielded area, for now.

containment_intro1                     When the viral outbreak occurred, I had a lot of trouble getting it under control.
containment_intro1b                    I had no choice but to shut down the Trunk Port gate system that connects each location in Darwinia.
containment_intro2                     This is the only place where I was able to hold my ground against the Virus.  The double shield of this location acts as a fantastic barrier.
containment_intro3                     I've highlighted the three disabled Trunk Ports on this island, and you'll need to open all of them.
containment_intro3b                    Once opened, the Trunk Ports will give us access to a number of important locations for later.
containment_rescuedw1                  But really, this is the important bit.  These guys are the Darwinians.
containment_rescuedw1b                 I've spent the better part of the last decade nurturing these fellows, and I'm very proud of them indeed.
containment_rescuedw2                  If the virus had its way, they'd all be dead already.  But I've managed to save a few of them.
containment_rescuedw2b                 There have been over ten-thousand generations of Darwinians, and the loss in AI research alone would be unthinkable.
containment_rescuedw3                  They're an astonishing act of creation.  Each and every Darwinian has his own digital soul which occupies his body during life, and returns to the Central Repository after death.
containment_rescuedw4                  You'll need to help me rebuild their numbers.  I'll help you out as you go.  For now, start clearing out the viral infection outside the shielded area.

containment_incubator_1                The incubator is running!  This is excellent.  The Engineers will pick up all the souls of the dead creatures nearby, and drop them into this building.
containment_incubator_2                Those souls will then be converted back into Darwinians, one at a time.  This is how we will rebuild the Darwinian population.
containment_incubator_3                Unfortunately, I designed the system so that the Darwinians have their own free will - which means we can't directly control them like you do with the Squad.
containment_incubator_4                But there are ways we can influence them indirectly.  Carry on clearing up the infection and harvesting the spirits...I'll get back to you.

containment_officer_1                  Oh fantastic, you've found my code for the Officer program.  This handy little program will enable you to promote individual Darwinians to Officers, and use those Officers to order the other Darwinians around.
containment_officer_2_kbd              To create an Officer, draw this gesture then click on a Darwinian you wish to Promote.
containment_officer_2_xin              To create an Officer, draw this gesture then select a Darwinian you wish to Promote.
containment_officer_2_icons_kbd        To create an Officer, bring up the Task Manager and click on the Officer icon.  Then click on a Darwinian you wish to Promote.
containment_officer_2_icons_xin        To create an Officer, bring up the Task Manager and select the Officer icon.  Then select a Darwinian you wish to Promote.
containment_officer_3                  The Darwinians that you've birthed so far aren't safe...I want you to move them under the tree inside the shielded area (highlighted), using the Officer program.

containment_rescuedws_1                Good work, looks like some of the Darwinians have reached the safe area.  But it's not enough.  If we're going to get Darwinia back online, we'll need quite a few more.
containment_rescuedws_2                I think we should aim to get around 150 Darwinians into the safe area.  Clear out the infection on the neighbouring islands, harvest the souls, and escort the Darwinians safely back until you have enough.

containment_objective_2                Rescue 150 Darwinians

containment_finished_1                 I think that's plenty of Darwinians in the safe area now.


# ================================================
# Cutscene after containment
# ================================================

containmentend_1                       I've been working on a design for a Weapons Platform that the Darwinians can use to fight the Virus.
containmentend_1b                      There's still a lot of work to do, but we can manufacture these weapons within Darwinia.
containmentend_2                       Darwinia already has a solid engineering system for building things, but like everything else, it's offline.
containmentend_2b                      The system is built over three locations - the Mine, the Generator, and the Yard.
containmentend_3                       Let me show you the Mines first.

containmentend_mine1                   This entire location is one giant mining facility, unfortunately now overrun by this damn Virus.
containmentend_mine1b                  Raw Polygons are ripped out of the hillside and dumped onto the passing mine carts.
containmentend_mine2                   Those Polygons then pass through this Refinery which converts them into Primitives.
containmentend_mine3                   I designed this world to be owned and operated entirely by the Darwinians.  All these buildings need Darwinians at their controls in order to function.
containmentend_mine3b                  Entire generations of Darwinian miners have worked these quarries before the Virus arrived.
containmentend_mine4                   Anyway,
containmentend_mine5                   Once the Primitives have been refined, they need to be transported to the Construction Yard where we can make some use of them.

containmentend_5                       So the Mines produce refined Primitives and send them to the Yard.
containmentend_5b                      The Yard also requires Energy, which comes from the Generator.

containmentend_generator1              This is the Generator.  Here the Energy that drives Darwinia is produced and regulated.
containmentend_generator1b             The Solar Panels dotted around this location harness the energy radiated out by the Soul Repository at the centre of Darwinia.
containmentend_generator2              Like most buildings in Darwinia, these Solar Panels require Darwinians at their control pads in order to operate.
containmentend_generator3              This building is Darwinia's Primary Power Generator.
containmentend_generator3b             It modulates the power from the Solar Panels into a Regulated Energy Stream that we can use.
containmentend_generator4              That Energy Stream then passes through the Trunk Port to the Construction Yard.
containmentend_generator5              Unfortunately this Trunk Port is broken, so we'll have to enable the link from the other end once we reach the Yard.

containmentend_6                       So the Generator produces the Energy.
containmentend_6b                      The Yard receives the Energy and the Primitives, and that's where we will be building the new weapons platform.
containmentend_7                       If you need help with these tasks, open the Objectives Screen...
containmentend_7_kbd                   If you need help with these tasks, just hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and push your mouse to the right for the Objectives Screen...
containmentend_7_icons                 If you need help with these tasks, open the Objectives Screen...
containmentend_7_icons_kbd             If you need help with these tasks, just hold [KEYICONSTASKMANAGERDISPLAY] and push your mouse down for the Objectives Screen...
containmentend_7b_kbd                  ...There you can click on an objective and I'll do my best to clarify it for you.
containmentend_7b_xin                  ...There you can select an objective and I'll do my best to clarify it for you.
containmentend_8                       Good luck!

puritycontrol_1                        Ok, it's time for us to come clean.  We know you didn't actually pay for this game and that you downloaded it from the Internet instead.
puritycontrol_2                        Fair enough, we're not going to judge you for that, and we know that it's not the same thing as actually stealing something from a shop.
puritycontrol_3                        But this game was made by a tiny team of independent developers, who worked for 3 years to bring the game to completion.
puritycontrol_4                        Introversion Software will not survive and we won't be able to make more games like Darwinia and Uplink if everybody pirates our games instead of buying them.
puritycontrol_5                        If you've enjoyed playing the game so far, we'd like to request that you now visit our website and buy the full game.
puritycontrol_6                        Thank you very much for playing Darwinia, and we really do hope that you choose to do the right thing.


# ================================================
# Generator
# ================================================

generator_objective1                   Generate 65 Gq/s Energy

generator_primary_1                    This building is Darwinia's primary power Generator.  It supplies power to every location and every building in this world.
generator_primary_2                    We're going to start building things we can use as weapons against the invasion, and for that we're going to need a lot more Energy.
generator_panels_1                     There are three groups of Solar Panels dotted around the landscape.  Like most of the buildings in this world, they require Darwinians manning them in order to operate.
generator_panels_2                     Once they're online, they will harness the energy radiated out from the Soul Repository at the centre of Darwinia.
generator_panels_3                     That energy is then transferred through pylons to the primary Generator, where it is modulated into a form that can be used by buildings all around the world.
generator_panels_4                     We'll need to achieve a power output of at least 65 Gigaquads per second in order to do anything substantial.
generator_panels_5                     This trunk port would normally transfer the modulated energy to the Construction Yard.
generator_panels_6                     Unfortunately there's no way to access it here, so we'll have to open it from the other end at the Construction Yard.
generator_panels_7                     But we'll worry about that later.


# ================================================
# Cutscene after Mine and Generator
# ================================================

yard_available_1                       OK I've finished the blueprints for the Weapons Platform and uploaded them into the system.
yard_available_2                       When you're ready, come down to the Yard level.  We'll need to bring it online and begin production immediately.


# ================================================
# Construction Yard
# ================================================

yard_objective_1                       Enable Generator Trunk Port
yard_objective_2                       Begin Armour Production
yard_objective_3                       Destroy Ant Infection

yard_intro_1                           This is the Construction Yard.  From here I was able to boot-strap the production of virtually every building in Darwinia.
yard_intro_2                           The Darwinians sometimes use the Yard to build things of their own when they think I'm not looking.  I would show you if I had the time.
yard_intro_3                           But that will all have to wait.
yard_genport_1                         If you remember, we couldn't open the Trunk Port connection from the Generator.
yard_genport_2                         You'll need to open the connection from this end to allow the Regulated Energy Stream to pass through.
yard_intro_4                           This Construction Yard drives the mine carts.  The refined Primitives from the Mine will come through once the carts are moving.
yard_intro_5                           The Yard will take the refined Primitives and the Regulated Energy Stream, and will start producing our weapons platforms, which I've called Armour.
yard_intro_6                           What I've designed is sort of an armoured troop carrier that can be converted into a Battle Cannon, that either you or the Darwinians can operate.
yard_safearea_1                        Once the Yard is online and producing Armour, wipe out the Ant infestation around this area and open up the Trunk Ports.
yard_safearea_2                        This is a jumping off point to the heavily infected areas of Darwinia, so it needs to be completely cleared.
yard_intro_7                           Once we have these new weapons, we'll stand a very good chance against the core infection.  Good luck.

yard_progress_1                        OK, the Trunk Port link from the Generator is up and running, and we're receiving the Energy stream.
yard_progress_2                        Let's push on to the Construction Yard and get it up and running.

yard_progressarmour_1                  Well done, we're now producing Armour.
yard_progressarmour_2                  We now need to clear out the Ant Infestation that's currently clogging up the valley.
yard_progressarmour_3                  I'd recommend you make use of the new Armour.  It can be deployed as a Battle Cannon, which should have no trouble clearing up that mess.

yard_finished_1                        I've added the Armour program to your gesture list.  You can now summon Armour to any location by drawing this gesture.
yard_finished_1_icons_kbd              I've added the Armour program to your list.  You can now summon Armour to any location from the Task Manager by clicking on the Armour icon.
yard_finished_1_icons_xin              I've added the Armour program to your list.  You can now summon Armour to any location from the Task Manager by selecting the Armour icon.
yard_finished_2                        The Armour will have to travel through the Trunk Port system, so you'll only be able to summon Armour near a local Trunk Port that you control.

biospherealpha_objective               Rescue 100 Darwinians

biospherealpha_primary1                A large number of Darwinians are trapped here and need to be rescued.
biospherealpha_primary2                They've no way to reach safety on their own, and right now we need every Darwinian we can get.
biospherealpha_primary3                Open up the Radar Dish links and escort the Darwinians through them onto the main island.
biospherealpha_primary4                You'll have to fight your way through some fairly heavy viral infection.
biospherealpha_primary5                This is the ultimate target area.  Once the Darwinians reach here they'll be safe.  I want you to get at least 100 into this area.


# ================================================
# Cutscene after Yard
# ================================================

yardend_1                              It's an unfortunate fact that the areas of Darwinia that used to be heavily populated are now the most heavily infected.
yardend_1b                             Those are the areas we must now visit.
yardend_2                              We need to make a concerted effort to rebuild the Darwinian population to its former strength, and wipe out the Viral Infection once and for all.
yardend_3                              The Soul Repository at the centre of Darwinia is the key to the Evolution and Rebirth system for the Darwinians.
yardend_3b                             The Souls of all the dead creatures eventually rise up and merge into the Repository, adding their experiences and wisdom to the group.
yardend_4                              The Souls are slowly ordered based on how successful they were in life, and are sent back down to the Receiver location, to be eventually reborn into new Darwinians.

yardend_5                              Here at the Receiver location, those Souls that were most successful in their previous lives slowly float down to the surface for another chance.
yardend_6                              The buildings you see dotted around the landscape are designed to collect up the falling Souls and send them to the Biosphere.
yardend_7                              For the Darwinians, this is the most sacred and holy site in all of the world.
yardend_7b                             It is something of a ritual for Darwinians to journey here on a pilgrimage early in the lives, to help with the rebirthing process.
yardend_8                              Through this method, each generation of Darwinian comes of age by helping the next generation into the world.

yardend_9                              When a Soul has spent a certain amount of time in the central Repository, it loses a great deal of its former structure.
yardend_9b                             In essence, a Soul forgets what it was like to exist on the surface.
yardend_10                             These Souls need processing before they can re-enter the world as Darwinians.  Part of this Reprocessing occurs at the Pattern Buffer.

yardend_11                             The Pattern Buffer contains the Master Blueprint for a Darwinian.
yardend_12                             This chunk of data is the raw digital Pattern that prepares an Unprocessed Soul to be birthed into the world.
yardend_13                             The Pattern is able to change as time passes, and represents the combined knowledge and abilities of every Darwinian that has ever lived.

yardend_14                             So the Receiver collects up the Unprocessed Souls that fall from the Repository.
yardend_15                             The Pattern Buffer stores the Master Blueprint for preparing an Unprocessed Soul.
yardend_16                             The Pattern and the Unprocessed Souls are sent through the Trunk Port system to the Biosphere, where they are birthed into Darwinians.
yardend_17                             Your task now is to re-enable these systems, and rebuild the Darwinian population.  Good luck.


# ================================================
# Receiver
# ================================================

receiver_objective1                    Collect 50 Souls per minute
receiver_objective2                    Enable Biosphere Trunk Port

receiver_primary_1                     Each of those collectors requires Darwinians at its base to operate, which means you'll have to clear out the viral infection first.
receiver_primary_2                     The grid then transports those Unprocessed Souls here.  This building brings together all the Unprocessed Souls from the grid and feeds them down a single line.
receiver_primary_3                     We will need to achieve a throughput of at least 50 Unprocessed Souls a minute to stand a chance of rebuilding the bulk of the Darwinian population.
receiver_primary_4                     Those Unprocessed Souls are then transported to the Biosphere, where they are processed and birthed into new Darwinians.

receiver_trunk_1                       Once the Souls have been collected by the Spirit Receivers, they need to be transported to Darwinia's primary Biosphere.
receiver_trunk_2                       There they will be processed and birthed into new Darwinians.  Open this Trunk Port to allow the Souls to be transmitted.


# ================================================
# Pattern Buffer
# ================================================

patternbuffer_objective1               Clear Pattern Infection
patternbuffer_objective2               Enable Biosphere Trunk Port

patternbuffer_primary_1                Unfortunately, the viral infection has spread to the Master Blueprint, and we need to clear it up.
patternbuffer_primary_2                There are four Pattern Loaders dotted around the location.  Each one must be occupied by Darwinians.
patternbuffer_primary_3                The Pattern Loaders are a safety step that I'm glad I thought of.  They will analyse and copy the Pattern in the Darwinians occupying the building.
patternbuffer_primary_4                That Pattern will then be beamed into the Master Blueprint by the hovering satellite dishes, overwriting the infection.
patternbuffer_primary_5                You'll need to occupy at least three of the Pattern Loaders to overwhelm the corruption in the Master Pattern.

patternbuffer_trunk_1                  The Master Blueprint needs to be transmitted to the Biosphere through this Trunk Port.
patternbuffer_trunk_2                  That's strange, this Trunk Port has already been opened.

patternbuffer_redarmy_1                What on Earth...
patternbuffer_redarmy_2                How did they get here?
patternbuffer_redarmy_3                Be careful, it looks like we've got some corrupted Darwinians transporting to the location, and they don't look friendly.


# ================================================
# Cutscene after Receiver and Pattern Buffer
# ================================================

prebiosphere_1                         Those evil Darwinians that we saw at the Pattern Buffer definitely came from the Biosphere.
prebiosphere_2                         It looks like the Virus infected some of the birthing equipment, and the corrupted Pattern caused Red Darwinians to be born instead of Green.
prebiosphere_3                         This is an unexpected development.  It's going to make recapturing the Biosphere a lot harder.


# ================================================
# Biosphere
# ================================================

biosphere_objective1                   Wipe out Red Army

biosphere_primary_1                    This is it, the birthplace of the Darwinian civilisation.  Every Darwinian that has ever lived was originally born here.
biosphere_primary_2                    If we can capture this Biosphere, we'll have the Darwinian population back to its former numbers in no time.
biosphere_primary_3                    The Darwinians are born from Spawn Points that are dotted all around the local islands.  Like all buildings in Darwinia, these Spawn Points need Darwinians to operate.
biosphere_primary_4                    In order to prevent chronic overpopulation, there are limits to how many Darwinians can be Spawned on each island.
biosphere_primary_5                    This is the Master Spawn Point, and it is responsible for controlling the global birth rate.  It controls and synchronises every other Spawn Point around it.
biosphere_primary_6                    It takes the Unprocessed Spirits from the Receiver Location, and processes them using the code signal from the Pattern Buffer.
biosphere_primary_7                    It then sends out those newly processed Spirits to the Spawn Points that need them.
biosphere_primary_8                    Unfortunately, the Viral corruption to the Pattern has resulted in this whole location being filled with Evil Darwinians.
biosphere_primary_9                    You'll have to build up your Green Darwinian Army and take them on directly for control of the Spawn Points.
biosphere_primary_10                   This is going to be a tough battle, but hopefully a decisive one.  This is one of the last locations that is still heavily infected.  Good luck.

biosphere_reddead_1                    It looks like we've pretty much wiped out the Red Army.

biosphere_end_1                        I've figured it out!  I've figured out how this whole thing happened.
biosphere_end_2                        Come down to the Temple...I'll show you.  And I know how to stop it once and for all.

rockhead_1                             The Darwinian's saw a picture of me once.  They didn't stop celebrating for days.  For just a few seconds, my ridiculous face was projected onto the sky all over Darwinia.
rockhead_2                             I was working on the code for rendering the sky, and the texture data was accidentally overwritten with a live image from my Webcam, similar to what you see on your screen when I'm talking to you.
rockhead_3                             Ever since that day, the Darwinians have been hijacking the Construction Yard when I'm not looking and using it to build these rock faces, which they then transport all over the world.
rockhead_4                             It made me realise what an enormous responsibility I have as their Creator.


# ================================================
# Temple
# ================================================

temple_intro_1                         Long ago, the Darwinians began work on a temple.  It was their dream, I think, to somehow begin communicating with me.
temple_intro_2                         It never occurred to me that one day they might actually succeed.
temple_intro_3                         It's really quite ingenious.  They found a way to align one of the Trunk Ports with what they believed was Heaven...the Soul Repository at the centre of Darwinia.
temple_intro_4                         Thinking they were talking to God, they'd managed to open up a data stream and began downloading files from my computer.
temple_intro_5                         My Research Programs were the first files to move through the link.
temple_intro_6                         My attention was elsewhere.  I should have been watching them more closely.
temple_intro_7                         They had the schematics and designs for how Darwinia was built.  They weren't ready for this information.
temple_intro_8                         For the first time ever, they began to understand the nature of their simulated digital existence.
temple_intro_9                         Next they downloaded all of my emails.  This was when I noticed something was wrong.
temple_intro_10                        Fearing what would happen next, I shut down the Link.  But it was too late.
temple_intro_11                        Amongst the emails were a couple of Spam Mails, infected with a particularly nasty strain of Internet Virus.
temple_intro_13                        I couldn't quite believe it was happening.
temple_intro_14                        The Virus warped the Darwinians into the destructive creatures we've been fighting all this time.
temple_intro_15                        Then they turned on the survivors.
temple_intro_16                        They replicated themselves at such a terrifying rate.  They'd taken over most of the system before I could contain them.
temple_intro_17                        In all honesty I had my finger on the Global Reset button.  I really did think my life's work had been ruined.
temple_intro_18                        It was just at that moment when you arrived.  And thank God you arrived when you did!

temple_primary_1                       Three of the infected spam emails still exist, and they are all still active.
temple_primary_1b                      Anything that goes near them will be corrupted and converted into the Virus.
temple_primary_2                       The good news is that we've cornered the Virus at this location.  These infected emails are the last source of the Virus that need to be destroyed.
temple_primary_3                       You'll need to fight your way up to them and destroy them with explosives at close range.  Go for it!

# Outro
# =================================================

outro_biosphere_1                      I don't think the Darwinians will ever truly forget what has happened.
outro_biosphere_1b                     In fact, I think this will turn out to be a defining moment in their history.
outro_biosphere_2                      They're much more ambitious now, bolder and stronger and smarter than they ever were.  But their innocence has been lost.
outro_biosphere_2b                     The battle at the Biosphere is without doubt the darkest chapter yet in Darwinia's history.
outro_biosphere_3                      The horrific loss of life in such a short period of time, and the very concept of Darwinians fighting and killing their own kin, makes it particularly potent for me.

outro_receiver_1                       Of all those who died, the Darwinians who fell under the Soul Destroyers will linger most in the survivors' memories.
outro_receiver_2                       Their Souls are irretrievably lost, with no possible hope of afterlife or rebirth awaiting them.
outro_receiver_3                       Their broken spirits will continue to haunt the places where they fell, until the end of the world.
outro_receiver_4                       Because of this, the Darwinians now understand, for the first time I think, what it truly means for one of their kind to die.

outro_containment_1                    It is my dream that Darwinia will continue to evolve and grow, long after I am gone.
outro_containment_1b                   I started the Darwin Digital Life project over a decade ago, and I've worked on it every single day in virtual isolation for all this time...
outro_containment_2                    ...only for my life's work to be saved today by a total stranger.
outro_containment_3                    I want you to help me continue my work.  I'm transferring a profile to you that will give you access to every location in Darwinia.
outro_containment_4                    It is clear to me now that I am no longer capable of running Darwinia on my own.  I want to give you the tools I used to build this world.
outro_containment_5                    I want you to help me finish it.

outro_10                               I'm transferring permissions to the World Editor to your computer.  That's the tool I used to build every location you've seen so far.  You can access it from the Main Menu when you're up in Heaven.
outro_11                               I'm also transferring a new user profile to your system, which I've called AccessAllAreas.  You can load it from the Profiles menu.  It will give you full access to all the locations you've visited in Darwinia.

outro_1                                When I think of the number of stories and legends that must have been created since this outbreak occurred, well, it scares me.
outro_2                                I'm afraid the Darwinians have a very long memory.  They still tell mournful stories of the island that was lost in the Server crash last year.
outro_3                                I don't know what effect this war will have on the Darwinians.  And I don't know what they'll want to do next.
outro_4                                But I do know that our actions here will live on through tale and folklore, for generations of Darwinians to come.

Darwinia  -  Final Release                    Cracked by                DMA Crew                I've been coding for 38 hours straight getting this crack working. I just quickly wrote this intro. Sorry it's a bit crap but I only spent 12 minutes on it. Been drinking coffee and Red Bull all day - I think my frontal lobes are bleeding. Greetz to Alistair, Chris, Jo, Johnny, Mark, Michael, Tom and all the beta testers. Further greetz to the late Jay Miner for creating the Amiga and all demo coders everywhere for showing the rest of the world what computers are really for.                See you all again on the next quality release from DMA Crew...

bootloader_life                        GAME OF LIFE
bootloader_life_1                      These complex behaviour patterns emerge from a very
bootloader_life_2                      simple set of basic rules, that all darwinians in the colony obey.
bootloader_life_3                      These rules are based on the well known 'Game Of Life' designed by John Conway.
bootloader_life_4                      - Three darwinians clustered around an empty cell will birth a new darwinian in that cell
bootloader_life_5                      - A darwinian in a cell with 2 or 3 neighbours will live a happy and sociable life
bootloader_life_6                      - A darwinian in a cell with just 1 neighbour or no neighbours will die a lonely soul
bootloader_life_7                      - A darwinian with 4 neighbours or more will die of starvation
bootloader_life_8                      - (added) A darwinian has a maximum life of 50 years
bootloader_life_9                      The Darwinians will live many happy and prosperous years under this simple system.
bootloader_life_10                     The final rule governing age is unique to Darwinia, and even though the colony may live
bootloader_life_11                     for many hundreds of years, this cruel addition is the touch of doom,
bootloader_life_12                     guaranteeing the eventual extinction of the entire tribe.
bootloader_life_13                     It was agreed by all on the Darwin Digital Life project that the Darwinians
bootloader_life_14                     must be taught the concept of their own mortality at the earliest possible opportunity.

multiwinia_helppage_general2_xin    Multiwinians can be promoted to Officers using the X button. Pressing X again near the Officer will make it order nearby Multiwinians into a powerful Formation mode, while pressing X further away from the Officer will make it order all Multiwinians to move to that position automatically. Officers (and all other units) can be reselected using the A Button, and Deselected with the B Button.

multiwinia_helppage_1_1              In Domination, the goal is to capture as many Spawn Points as you can before the timer runs out. The player with the most Spawn Points at the end of the game is the winner. Additionally, any team which doesn't have a Spawn Point for 30 seconds will be eliminated - if you eliminate all the enemy teams, you will also win the game.

multiwinia_helppage_2_1              In King of the Hill, your goal is to control as many of the Hill-Zones as you can for as long as possible. For every Zone that you control, you will score 1 point per second. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
multiwinia_helppage_2_2              In order to capture a Hill-Zone, simply move your Multiwinians inside of it. If there are no enemy Multiwinians present, you will gain control of the Zone and begin scoring points. If other Multiwinians are there already, then the team with the most Multiwinians present will control the Zone.

multiwinia_helppage_3_1              In Capture the Statue, you score points by lifting the giant statues and carrying them to your score zone. For every statue that you capture, you will score 1 point - the player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Statues will appear during the game in the white zones dotted about the levels.
multiwinia_helppage_3_2              To lift a statue and carry it away, you need to move a large number of Multiwinians close to it. Once you have enough Multiwinians nearby, they will lift it and begin carrying it automatically. If you want to make them carry it somewhere else, select the Multiwinians as normal, and then click the Right Mouse Button at the desired location.
multiwinia_helppage_3_2_xin          To lift a statue and carry it away, you need to move a large number of Multiwinians close to it. Once you have enough Multiwinians nearby, they will lift it and begin carrying it automatically. If you want to make them carry it somewhere else, select the Multiwinians as normal, and then press X at the desired location.
multiwinia_helppage_3_3              If there are enemy Multiwinians already at the statue, you will need to out-number them before you can lift the statue away. If they are already moving the statue, you can make them drop it by destroying enough of the Multiwinians carrying it.

multiwinia_helppage_4_1              In Assault, players are divided into 2 groups - Attackers and Defenders. The Defenders are given a heavily defended area which they must protect. The Attacker must break into this area and capture the Control Stations inside. The Attackers will always largely outnumber the Defenders, and receive regular reinforcements.
multiwinia_helppage_4_2              On each Assault map, there is a WMD belonging to the Defending team. This WMD is on a timer - once it reaches 0 it detonates, the Defenders win the game and the Attacking team is completely destroyed. If the Attacking team captures the Control Stations first, the WMD is destroyed, and they win the game.
multiwinia_helppage_4_3              Some Assault maps have large mobile explosives called Wall Busters. Multiwinians are able to carry these, and if they carry it directly into a defending wall, that wall and everything nearby will be destroyed.

multiwinia_helppage_5_1              Rocket Riot has 3 objectives. First, you must fuel your rocket, by capturing Solar Panels dotted around the map. Once your Rocket is fueled, you need to load Multiwinian passengers in to it. Your Rocket will then begin the launch countdown - you must defend your Rocket until it launches successfully.
multiwinia_helppage_5_2              Solar Panels are captured in the same way as Spawn Points - simply move your Multiwinians up to them. Solar Panels will power the fuel generators - the longer you hold the panels, the faster they will begin to generate fuel, so once you capture them, you need to make sure you hold onto them for maximum effect. 
multiwinia_helppage_5_3              Once your Rocket's fuel level reaches 95, you can begin loading Multiwinians. Multiwinians will board the Rocket automatically, but they need to be standing close to the rocket before they can do that. You will need to load 100 Multiwinians onto your Rocket before the launch sequence will begin.
multiwinia_helppage_5_4              Defending your Rocket is a very important task - once your Fuel level reaches 70, your Rocket will be vulnerable to attack from enemy Multiwinians. Enemy Multiwinians which get close to your Rocket will automatically attack it with grenades - if they do enough damage, your fuel and passengers will be burnt, and you will have to start over.

multiwinia_helppage_6_1              In Blitzkrieg, the goal is to eliminate enemy teams by capturing their flags. You cannot simply attack their flag right away though - you must link your own flag to your enemy's by capturing the other flags scattered throughout the level. Every time a flag is captured, by you or an enemy team, it will unlock other nearby flags for you to capture.
multiwinia_helppage_6_2              The first flag that you capture is your home flag. It is very important that you defend this flag - if an enemy captures your flag, and has a link back to their flag, you are out of the game. You can break this link by capturing any flag in between, but lose your home flag before you do, and you'll be eliminated from the game.
multiwinia_helppage_6_3              If you eliminate all the other teams on the map, you will win the game. If the time runs out before that happens, however, the winner will be determined by how well they did during the game. Each team currently left in the game will get 1 point for every flag they currently control, and 10 points for every team they have eliminated. Obviously, this means that eliminating enemy teams gives you a much better chance of winning the game.

mp_rocketriot_2p_3_name             Stairway to Heaven

mp_assault_4P_2_name               The Last Stand
mp_assault_4P_2_description        During the last big push by the Virus, the then near extinct Red Tribe made their last stand here, and were almost wiped out until the Green Multiwinians came to their aid. Such acts of co-operation are almost unheard of now, however

mp_assault_stress_description      Assault Stress Test Map

mp_blitzkrieg_2P_1_name            Confrontation Point
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_1_description     The Blue and Yellow tribes waged war here for many generations, until one of the Shamans summoned a terrible viral monstrosity from the depths of Darwinia (and was destroyed in the process). It took the combined forces of the Blue and Yellow Multiwinians to destroy it, and the Shamans have since gone into hiding
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_2_name            The Bleak Mountains
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_2_description     This location was created entirely by the Darwinians after the Great War, as they were learning more about their world and themselves. The power to manipulate the world in this way has since been lost to the Multiwinians
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_3_name            The Eye of the World
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_3_description     As the very lowest point of Darwinia, directly below the Soul Repository, this site had great spiritual significance to the Darwinians of old. To the Multiwinians, it is just another battle field.
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_4_name            The Apex of Infinity
mp_blitzkrieg_2P_4_description     This area was once used as a testing ground for a powerful explosive weapon, however the test went badly, wiping out everyone working on it. The idea has since been abandoned due to its unreliable nature.
mp_blitzkrieg_3P_1_name            Upon the Blazing Sea
mp_blitzkrieg_3P_1_description     Heated battles quickly began when this location was discovered as Multiwinians fought to secure a foothold
mp_blitzkrieg_3P_2_name            The Wheel
mp_blitzkrieg_3P_2_description     No one is really sure why battles rage here; the place has no tactical significance or resources to speak of. The few detractors of the Unending War say this place is proof that Multiwinians are fighting simply for the sake of fighting. No one else seems to care
mp_blitzkrieg_4P_2_name            Gridlock
mp_blitzkrieg_4P_2_description     This place was once the home of a huge fortress built by the Red Darwinians while they were still under the thrall of the Virus. It has since deteriorated into seperate parts which the Multiwinians now fight over
